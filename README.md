ðŸ“– Background

Young's modulus (also known as the elasticity modulus) quantifies how easily a material stretches or deforms under stress. This mechanical property plays a crucial role in the design and construction of everything from buildings to biomedical devices. By understanding how much force a material can tolerate before it deforms permanently, engineers and scientists can create safer and more efficient designs.

While professional-grade tensile testing machines already exist, their high cost often places them out of reach for schools and underfunded laboratories. This limits hands-on learning and exposure to important material science concepts.

To address this, we developed a simple, affordable tensile test machine using easily accessible components, including a Raspberry Pi for data acquisition and control. The system is designed to measure the Young's modulus of soft materials, making it ideal for educational use. Not only does this give students practical experience with physical testing and electronics, but it also introduces programming skills and data analysis â€” all while keeping the setup budget-friendly and approachable.
